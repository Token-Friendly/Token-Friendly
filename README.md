- <details><summary><b>3 methods to catch victims</b></summary>

   > All methods work exactly the same just through different places in the computer.
   > All methods use high-end nasted loop to hide the URLs _(to make it hard for them to find your discord webhook)_
   - Command Prompt
      - They paste the command into the window and you get all of their accounts
   - Batch file
      - They download the file, run it and you get all of their accounts
   - EXE file _(Compiled batch file in a way that its not going to be detected by anti-viruses)_
      > Note: this option is new and its still in beta _(available for use)_
      - They download and run a file which has 2 protection layers and you get all of their accounts
</details>

- <details><summary><b>Combine each 6 accounts found into 1 discord message</b></summary>

   > Each account found has its own embed.
   >
   > while discord allows to send 10 embeds within 1 message
   >
   > I decided that 6 in one message is fine.
   >
   > This is going to prevent rate-limits from discord while the victim is passing all of his accounts to your discord webhook.

## üí° Plans for future versions . . .
> Please note that while working on new versions I try to add as much taks as I can but I also want to guarantee that the task does not make the script detectable and also I would like them to be low on size.
- Add a system to prevent debugging apps (HTTP Debuggers)
- Anti VM Protection _(Toggleable setting)_
- Add a custom professional-styled version of the discord message sent to the webhook
- Add an encryption layer for the discord webhook
- Scanning for possible discord account passwords
- Suggest your ideas and if I like them you'll get credits!
